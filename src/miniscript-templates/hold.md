## Description

Hodl time locks letâ€™s user set specific time intervals, with a maximum of 24 months, during which their bitcoin remains locked. 

The hodl time lock feature prevents impulsive selling during market fluctuations and allows users to stick to their investment strategy.

## Vault Configuration Example
To spend the funds, the second condition must be met, which involves an absolute timelock represented by `1701559661` in the example. 

This timelock will be satisfied after the specified time [1 month] has passed since the creation of this transaction.
