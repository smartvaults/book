## Key Agency
- Key agents are trusted parties that hold custody of one or more keys on a multisig vault. See our [Key Agency FAQ](https://smartvaults.io)
- Key agents can use Smart Vaults to register, configure, and share their signers (x-pubs) with users.
- Key agents can specify their price in USD or sats, in price per signature and/or an annual flat rate or basis points.
- Users discover key agents through the Key Agent catalog, and they collaboratively build vaults.
- Key agent fees are auto-calculated and pro-rated, facilitating processing of micro-transactions to pay key agent fees during low chain-fee time periods. 
- Contact us via [Telegram](https://t.me/+I3B8_4tz7sMwZjVh) to become a verified key agent or try it out on the [testnet](https://smartvaults.dev).
